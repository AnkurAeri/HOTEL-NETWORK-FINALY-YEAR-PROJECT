# HOTEL-NETWORK-FINALY-YEAR-PROJECT

Project Summary: Established and integrated a computer network with connection to internet and Intranet in the Vic Modern Hotel on three floors with departmental subnetworks and wireless networks. 
 
 Key Responsibilities: 
 
 Network architecture design: Designed a three tier network architecture using routers and switches; where the core layer, distribution layer, and the access layer. 
 VLAN implementation: Developed a new VLAN for every department in order to improve security and manage the network better. 
 IP addressing: Provided the VLANâ€™s with unique IP address ranges. 
 Routing protocol configuration: With the intention to maintain an effective interconnection between VLANs we have deployed OSPF routing protocol. 
 DHCP server configuration: Provided facility for DHCP on routers so that IP address can be assigned to all devices dynamically. 
 Wireless network setup: Wireless access points which may be configured on each floor for the connection of laptops and phones through the Wi-Fi technology. 
 Security measures: Set up the SSH for establishing secure connection to the routers and also for setting up the port security on the IT department switch. 
 Technical Skills Highlighted: 
 
 Network design principles 
 VLAN configuration 
 IP addressing schemes 
 OSPF routing protocol 
 DHCP server configuration

 Project Outcomes: 
 
 Created and deployed a secured multiple VLAN network for Vic Modern Hotel. 
 Guaranteed the smooth interconnection of departments and availability of Internet resources. 
 Optimised management and security achieved by increasing the level of VLAN and port security. 
 Here I have demonstrated good knowledge of network design, configuration and security and such skills set is crucial for any one aspiring to be a network engineer.
